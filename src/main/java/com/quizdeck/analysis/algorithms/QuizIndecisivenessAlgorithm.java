/**
 * Algorithm for accessing the indecisiveness of quiz participants.
 * The following outputs are returned through the AnalysisResults interface:
 * Participant Sample Data:
 * -> All guesses to all questions by all quiz participants
 * Participant Statistical Data:
 * -> Number of guesses a given participant submitted to each question
 * -> Number of guesses a given participant submitted in total
 * -> Overall 'Indecisiveness' score of each participant
 * Quiz Statistical Data:
 * -> Overall 'Indecisiveness' score for each question in the quiz
 * -> Overall 'Indecisiveness' score for the quiz
 *
 * Notes:
 * -> If an 'Indecisiveness' score is   < 0 then too few guesses were submitted (Participants did not know what to respond?)
 *                                      = 0 exactly enough guesses were submitted (Participants were confident or did not have time to think)
 *                                      > 0 too many guesses were submitted (Participants did not know what to respond?)
 * -> Indecisiveness at the quiz level may be misleading as one participant may have submitted enough guesses to cover
 *      up the fact that another participant submitted too few guesses. Therefore, it is possible for participants to
 *      be indecisive and the quiz level stats not show this.
 *          I am unsure if there is anything that I can do to resolve this.
